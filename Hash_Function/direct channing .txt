"""
1) direct channing  

second is 2) Open Adddressing which includes 
                - linear probing 
                - quadratic probing
                - Double hashing

""" Direct chaning 
:implements the buckets as lineknd list , colliding elements are stored in this list 


[ refer to image direct channing .png ]
open Adressing   : colliding elemts are stor in other vackents buckets. DUring storage and
lookup these are found through so called probing 

    linear probing : it palces new key into closet following empty cell
